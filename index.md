I am a graduate student in the [Pathways Master's Program](https://lsa.umich.edu/mcdb/graduate-students/pathway-masters-program.html) within the Department of Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology at the University of Michigan. My primary research interests are in structural biology and protein biochemistry among other areas at the chemistry-biology interface, as well as the use of quantitative and computational approaches to advance these fields. To this end, I am also pursuing a graduate certificate in scientific computing.

I completed my undergraduate education in 2020 with a BS in biological physics and chemistry from Brandeis University, whose institution I have [criticized for inaction on matters of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI)](https://www.thejustice.org/staff/fox-baudelaire). Prior to that, I graduated from Bunker Hill Community College and had [experienced homelessness and food insecurity](https://www.circleofhopeonline.org/news/2019/11/21/helping-homeless-college-students-flourish-and-thrive). My first research experience was an NIH _Bridges to the Baccalaureate_ summer fellowship at the University of Massachusetts - Boston, where I helped characterize polyphenol oxidases in greenhouse-grown barley. Later, I contributed to applied microfluidics research in the Martin A. Fisher School of Physics at Brandeis, funded in part by an NSF REU program. With initial plans to defer a research career for service in the Peace Corps, I instead spent the year after graduation working in contact tracing with Partners In Health, COVID-19 diagnostics at the Broad Institute, and finally in protein expression and purification for Albany Molecular Research Inc. (now known as Curia).

At Brandeis, I fulfilled a minor concentration in philosophy. I maintain a broad interest in epistemology, history and philosophy of science, and questions of value and judgment in scientific practice, particularly as they relate to DEI issues in STEM education and participation in STEM fields. I have more ancillary engagement in topics such as the psychology of learning, the intersection of science with diplomacy and public policy, bridging the "two cultures" divide, and the humanistic significance of science.
